    <p>
        For this project I created a twelve inch model made out of plywood. This abstract model is composed of different shapes such as rounded diamonds, and elongated triangles. <br>
        It takes the form of a whales tail. My project is held together by two slot joints that intersect in the middle of the composition.This structure is meant to facilitate <br>
        a space for reflection. I intend for the space to go hand in hand with nature and for the viewer/audience to have a moment for themselves and nature to fully ponder <br>
        about our image and existence on this planet. I intend for the audience to be fully immersed into my structure and reflect. <br>
        <br>

        The space for this model is found within Nature. I love nature. Nature has always been a part of my life and it is something that is constantly around us. It is <br>
        the principle of design and beauty. I wanted Nature to be embedded and in mind while working on my structure. My structure is a receptacle of culture as it is able <br>
        to hold a frame for nature to thrive and move through the middle. However, it also promotes the creation of culture since it’s made of eco friendly materials that <br>
        can easily be reclaimed by nature if that’s what is supposed to happen. <br>
        <br>

        The atmosphere within my inhabitable space is one of serenity and reflection. At times it can be spiritual, but it is very much a space of exploration through reflection. <br>
        The shape of my model contributes to this atmosphere as it is similar to the shape of whale tails and waves found in water. Water has a very peaceful yet strong characteristic <br>
        and it offers life. In a similar way the opening in the middle of my model is a frame/window for viewers to either appreciate whoever or whatever is on the other side but also <br>
        for the wind and air to pass through. It is created this way so that there are no interruptions for nature and its path. In addition to the creation of the atmosphere, the choice <br>
        of material is very important. In order for this model to stay true to nature and fully be adaptable if needed, I wanted this model to be made out of an environmentally friendly <br>
        material. I want this structure to engage and coexist with nature rather than compete or disrupt nature. This closeness to Earth and this choice of natural wood contributes to <br>
        the atmosphere and the feeling created by this structure. The slot joint in the middle, carefully comprises this structure and fully forms a shape while at the same time being <br>
        carefully hidden so that it doesn’t disrupt from the actual design. <br>
        <br>

        Energy is able to freely flow through my structure by the careful addition of openings throughout. Through the creation of a frame/window in the middle, this structure isn’t <br>
        fully close and separate but rather welcoming for nature and individuals to come towards the center and see beyond.<br>
        <br>

        Two artists that had an influence in my making process and design were, Shigeru Ban and Zaha Hadid. I was inspired by Shigeru Ban’s process of creating structures out of <br>
        environmentally friendly materials and how to approach the values of the design with the space being created. I was also inspired by Zaha Hadid and her early drafts and <br>
        sketches for her work. It all starts with a shape and form and through this she was able to create magnificent structures. I was really inspired by this and often looked <br>
        back at the sketches that started making my brain work. I was also inspired by how her structures and designs often are able to carry energy throughout their outline. <br>
        This was something that I was thinking for my design and it can be seen through the repetition of shape and the waves in my structure. <br>
        <br>

        While working on my project, there were some tools that were a bit aggressive on my material and left some scars. While scars are natural and a part of nature, <br>
        it can also sometimes distract a little. I left the scars on my design because since my design is heavily influenced by nature, I understand that nature also <br>
        has scars but that doesn’t make it any less beautiful than it already is. <br>
        <br>

        The entire process of making and creating was so pleasant and wholesome. This is why I create.
