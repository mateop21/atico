      OUTSIDE  is the final installment of a two part project that depicts <br>
      and documents the similarity and contrast between inside and outside. <br>
      Whatever happens inside is influenced by what is going on outside and <br>
      vice versa. However in many ways the outside can be completely opposite <br>
      to what's inside. Outside can often be more rigid and constraining. <br>
      To make this depiction clear the use of color and shapes for the <br>
      second part of this project had to contrast what was done for the first <br>
      part. The exterior world can sometimes be too much and very dull at times. <br>
      A lot can go on, and our vision can get blurry at times. There always seems <br>
      to be a new focus or task to be completed and it can often feel as if we are <br>
      on autopilot. The only use of color can be seen on the top right corner of <br>
      this piece as it suggests a link to the inside world as well as a connection <br>
      to something higher. This connection can vary from ideas, morals, religion or more. <br>
      For this part of the project I solely focused on what was done for INSIDE, as both <br>
      of these must go hand in hand when placed together. This final installment on <br>
      my INSIDE/OUTSIDE  project incorporates elements from cubism, surrealism and abstraction. <br>
      All of these which I thoroughly enjoy and constantly inspire me to think differently.<br>
