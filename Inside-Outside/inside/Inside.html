    <p>
        INSIDE  is the first of a two part project that depicts and documents <br>
        the similarity and contrast between inside and outside. To me this meant <br>
        anything in my subconscious that came to me naturally. We all have different <br>
        instincts and skills. We all have shapes and figures that simply represent <br>
        who we are inside. Everyone has a distinct style whether they realize it or not. <br>
        Every time I have a creative block I always find myself drawing similar shapes <br>
        and figures. I used to get very frustrated with myself for constantly drawing <br>
        similar figures, but once I was able to get past that I began to create new <br>
        shapes and ideas. For this project I started by making a drawing on my <br>
        sketchbook with markers and pens that focused on shapes and images that<br>
         I had on my mind at the time. Sometimes it’s easier to allow yourself <br>
         to surrender to the shapes and just let your hand flow with the marker to <br>
         produce whatever needs to be done. I got a lot of inspiration from my visit <br>
         to the Whitney Museum, more specifically the art exhibition on Women and Abstraction <br>
          in the 1930’s. During the beginning stages of my project I was looking a lot <br>
          and drawing inspiration from the work of Esphyr Slobodkina and Rosalind Bengelsdorf.<br>
